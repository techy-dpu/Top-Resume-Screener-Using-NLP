# Top-Resume-Screener-Using-NLP

Resume Parser aims to speed up screening process of a candidate.
In the recruitment process, it is inefficient, slow, and costly to scan with hundreds of
resumes one by one based on the skill-set. Resume parser automates the screening.
Resume parsing is tricky. There are hundreds of ways of doing it.

role.
